🌟 About OpenFit-AI

Most fitness apps today focus on tracking your workouts, logging sets, reps, and providing standard exercise plans. These apps are fantastic for monitoring progress and maintaining routine. However, at OpenFit-AI, we wanted to explore something different—an app designed specifically for fitness enthusiasts who crave understanding, insight, and highly personalized guidance.

OpenFit-AI is built around the idea of empowering users with in-depth knowledge and reasoning behind every recommendation. It's ideal for those who don't just want to follow a workout blindly, but rather understand the "why" behind every move, how to optimize their fitness journey, and safely accommodate personal limitations or injuries.

🔍 How It Works (Tech Overview)

Behind the scenes, OpenFit-AI utilizes a robust yet cost-efficient multi-agent framework built on LangGraph. Communication is seamless and instantaneous via WebSockets (client.io), providing smooth real-time interaction. Our system efficiently retrieves relevant information from Supabase, ensuring quick, accurate responses. Each interaction costs under $0.002, making this powerful personalization highly accessible and sustainable.

💡 Why OpenFit-AI?

Traditional fitness apps cover routine well—but OpenFit-AI is for the curious, the enthusiasts, those who value knowledge as much as results. If you've ever wondered about the reasoning behind your workout routines, questioned how certain exercises specifically benefit your goals, or needed personalized plans to safely work around injuries, OpenFit-AI is built for you.

📈 The Future is Open

OpenFit-AI is currently open-source, freely available, and community-driven. While in open beta, usage is completely free, but we've set a fair usage policy of 50 interactions per user per day, regardless of which part of the app is used. This ensures the system remains accessible and performant for everyone.

It’s created by me (a self-taught AI practitioner passionate about fitness and technology). For now, it’s a solo effort, but the goal is to grow this into a collaborative, community-driven project. If you're passionate about fitness, AI, or just like building cool and useful things—you're warmly invited to join and contribute.

Your feedback and ideas are crucial to evolving the platform. We’re here to learn together, experiment, and push boundaries—making fitness not just about doing, but about truly understanding.

Let’s build the future of intelligent fitness guidance—together at OpenFit-AI!
