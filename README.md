### Text Formatting

#### Workout Days
Format workout days in bold:
```markdown

```
These are rendered with a blue background and blue left border.

#### Measurements & Calculations
Format calculations consistently using bold:
```markdown

**Total Daily Calories = 2000 calories/day**
**Protein = 150g protein**
**Fats = 60g grams**
**Carbohydrates = 200g grams**
```

#### Macronutrients
Format macro breakdowns using italics with this exact pattern:
```markdown
_Macros: Approximately 30g protein, 45g carbs, 15g fat_
```
These are rendered as distinct colored pills for each macro.

### Lists
Use standard markdown lists:
```markdown
- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
```
Keep lists clean with single line breaks between items.

### Spacing & Structure
- Separate major sections with horizontal rules (`---`)
- Avoid using more than two consecutive line breaks
- Keep paragraphs concise
